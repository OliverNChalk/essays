# What is MakerDAO
A lot of MakerDAO's supporters and critics think it is simply a stablecoin protocol. In this article I go over the core MakerDAO products, the $MKR token, and why MakerDAO is not primarily a stablecoin but rather a decentralized credit system.

### MakerDAO System Overview
There are a few core components in the MCD (Multi-Collateral DAI) system:
 - Vaults: Borrowers can access $DAI loans by posting collateral
 - $MKR: Governance & buyers of last resort
 - $DAI: Synthetic USD

And we also have some core actors:
 - Vault owners, access liquidity against worthy collateral
 - $MKR Holders
   - Take on systemic risk (they risk dilution)
   - Recipients of system earnings
   - Right to govern risk parameters
 - $DAI Holders
   - Seek USD exposure
   - Potentially paid to hold $DAI (via the DSR - Dai Savings Rate)

Most people (especially ETH-maxis) only see a stablecoin when they look at $DAI but the real innovations here is the credit protocol that lets business and individuals access liquidity against their ivnestments (liquid assets) or assets (often illiquid). This system has the potential to scale massively, as a credit enabling protocol, not so much as a stablecoin.

### Competing Synthetic Protocols

- MakerDAO bad for leverage
- Competitors are numerous
- Building a synthetic USD is not unique to MKR, nor is MKR the optimal way to do it
